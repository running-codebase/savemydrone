# FlightCheckR

FlightcheckR was created at the Melbourne Nasa Hackathon 2016. It is a one stop shop solution for drone operators looking to get preflight information on no fly zones, weather conditions and other drone operators flight logs. 

It also provides live weather updates, flight timer and flight logging to aid the pilot.

It won the Best Mission Concept award after it's presentation at the end of the hackathon.
